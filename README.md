<h1>Weather App</h1>
<p>Hello, this is my Weather App. My second project that is being completed after I decided to become a developer.</p>
<p>I used technologies such as CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript in this app. Requests from an <a href='https://openweathermap.org/api'>openweather</a> API were also used which provides information by the name of the name city in wich the user searches.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The user enters the name of the city. After the name is entered the application makes requests for information via the openweather API relating to the name entered by the user. After the API makes the requests and receives them correctly, the information is displayed on the screen</p>
